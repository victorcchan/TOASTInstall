.bashrc function:
toast() {
    source ${HOME}/venv-toast/bin/activate
    export PATH=$HOME/venv-toast/bin/:$PATH
    export CPATH=$HOME/venv-toast/include:$CPATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/venv-toast/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/venv-toast/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/venv-toast/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/venv-toast/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    pysite=$(python3 --version 2>&1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e "s#\(.*\)\.\(.*\)\..*#\1.\2#")
    export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/venv-toast/lib/python${pysite}/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}"
}
